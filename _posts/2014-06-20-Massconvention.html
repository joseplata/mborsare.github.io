summary: The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority is a national leader in the convention and meetings industry. Their previous website didnâ€™t reflect this level of sophistication. In the fall of 2012 I was the lead designer on a team that redesigned their website. This site is fully responsive for a seamless desktop to mobile experience. The initial round of concepts for the site are below followed by the chosen design.
